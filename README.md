# MCP Claude Enhancements

Welcome to my project enhancing Claude Desktop with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** framework! This repository showcases custom Python tools I built to add local file access and interaction features. 

## Features
- **Leave Policy Lookup**: Extracts text from a PDF to answer leave-related queries.
- **Conversation Saver**: Saves chat logs to timestamped files on your desktop.
- **Greeter**: Responds with a customised welcome for "Hi", "Hey", or "Hello".
- **File Counter**: Counts files on your desktop.

## Why This Project?
I created this to explore how MCP can extend desktop applications with practical tools. It’s a mix of real-world utility and technical creativity—perfect for sharing with the community!
